## Getting started with git

To clone the main branch of the project run the following code:

``` git clone https://github.com/LOdweebles/SE2-Coursework.git ```

Each week, the ScrumMaster should create a new branch of the main project for the weeks sprint. To do this run the following command:

``` git branch <sprintname>
git checkout <sprintname>
```

This will create a new branch. To merge this back into the main branch, run the following:

``` 
git add .
git commit â€“m "Some commit message"
git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
git merge <sprintname>
```

Push the code back up to the main github repository:

``` git push https://github.com/LOdweebles/SE2-Coursework.git main ```


## How to compile and run
Navigate to your favourite Terminal/ command line utility to the NewBank folder from the clone request. Run the following code:

```
javac newbank/server/NewBankServer.java
java newbank/server/NewBankServer
```

This will compile and run the server in that Terminal window.

Then open another Terminal window and run the following:

```
javac newbank/client/NewBankClient.java
java newbank/client/NewBankClient
```

This will execute the client that will connect to the local host of the running server application.

To stop all processes, use CTRL+C in the Terminal window running the server process.
