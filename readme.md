## How to compile and run
Navigate to your favourite Terminal/ command line utility to the NewBank folder from the clone request. Run the following code:

```
javac newbank/server/NewBankServer.java
java newbank/server/NewBankServer
```

This will compile and run the server in that Terminal window.

Then open another Terminal window and run the following:

```
javac newbank/client/NewBankClient.java
java newbank/client/NewBankClient
```

This will execute the client that will connect to the local host of the running server application.

To stop all processes, use CTRL+C in the Terminal window running the server process.
