# A New Bank

A New Bank is an API based banking app that runs in the command line. Supported operations:

- SHOWALLACCOUNTS
- NEWCURRENT
- NEWSAVINGS
- INFO
- TRANSFER 100.0 TO userName
- VIEWSTATEMENT
- EDITPROFILE
- RESETPASSWORD
- EXIT

## Features

### Client

- **User menu** provided to the user to login, create an account or gracefully exit the bank. Login details are collected and sent to the server to validate.
- **Password masking** to hide the password during input to ensure that evesdroppers cannot see the password being entered. This works similar to UNIX password entry with no characters showing.
- **Hashing of passwords** so that only hashed values and not plaintext are sent to the server.

### Server

- **Databasing of users through object serialisation** to allow persistence of account details as the bank restarts. Consider adding a cloud database system in later iterations
- **SHOWALLACCOUNTS** returns a list of all of the accounts a user has under their name
- **NEWCURRENT** creates a new current account for the user.
- **NEWSAVINGS** creates a new savings account for the user.
- **INFO** displays all of the users details, such as username, name, email and account info and balances.
- **TRANSFER** allows the tranfer between current accounts between people. Usage is TRANSFER double TO user
- **VIEWSTATEMENT** displays the logs for a particular account, showing all transfers in and out. 
- **EDITPROFILE** allows the user to change their email, phone and address in their profile. Usage is EDITPROFILE email address phone
- **RESETPASSWORD** allows the user to reset their password. Usage is RESETPASSWORD newpassword newpassword
- **EXIT** allows the user to gracefully exit the bank, ending the server thread and the client.

## Getting started with git

To clone the main branch of the project run the following code:

``` git clone https://github.com/LOdweebles/SE2-Coursework.git ```

Each week, the ScrumMaster should create a new branch of the main project for the weeks sprint. To do this run the following command:

``` git branch <sprintname>
git checkout <sprintname>
```

This will create a new branch. To merge this back into the main branch, run the following:

``` 
git add .
git commit â€“m "Some commit message"
git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
git merge <sprintname>
```

Push the code back up to the main github repository:

``` git push origin main ```


## How to compile and run
Navigate to your favourite Terminal/ command line utility to the NewBank folder from the clone request. Run the following code:

```
javac newbank/server/NewBankServer.java
java newbank/server/NewBankServer
```

This will compile and run the server in that Terminal window.

Then open another Terminal window and run the following:

```
javac newbank/client/NewBankClient.java
java newbank/client/NewBankClient
```

This will execute the client that will connect to the local host of the running server application.

To stop all processes, use CTRL+C in the Terminal window running the server process.

## Roadmap: Tasks for this weeks sprint
